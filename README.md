# What is this ? 
An app start-up launch page. Building off a template, I was able to include graphics made by the client (in Canva), press clippings (newspaper and video), and the clickable model the client had made. 

# Some cool features
- responsive
- sticky menu bar
- buttons ready to link up with the app stores

# Screen captures
